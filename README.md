### steamquery by devusSs ðŸš€

steamquery is a CLI tool that allows users to keep track of their [Counter-Strike 2](https://www.counter-strike.net/) inventory via automation and [Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/) by only applying a basic configuration.

It originally was called [steamquery-v2](https://github.com/devusSs/steamquery-v2) and was quite a clumsy project since code and features were added on the fly and without any intention of clean code or similar ideas. This projects aims to improve said problems.

### Why would I use this?

- quick runtimes (on a decent connection around 15 secs for an entire run)
- does not only track your inventory but also custom items if you'd like to (see below for more information)
- no installation or build needed, just download an already compiled release
- unlike some websites you do not need to login via Steam

### Why does the tool need my Steam API key?

The tool makes a request to the Steam API to check whether the session logons and the steam community are available for [Counter-Strike 2](https://www.counter-strike.net/). That's the only reason the program needs your API key.

### Usage

Download an already compiled [release](https://github.com/devusSs/steamquery/latest) and store it somewhere on your system.

You will then need to create a [Google service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) for the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts) and store in a directory you would like to use.

You will also need to setup a config file:

```json
{
  "steam_user_id_64": 0,
  "steam_api_key": "your_steam_api_key",
  "spreadsheet_id": "spreadsheet_id_not_name_or_table"
}
```

You can call the config files whatever you would like to but will then need to specify them using the `-g` flag for the Google Cloud file and the `-c` for the config file.

If you would like to know more about flags run `steamquery --help`.

### Custom Configuration

As mentioned earlier you can specify additional items which might not be in your inventory or in storage units which cannot be fetched via the API or a website.

To do that simply add a items file and specify it using the `-i` flag when running steamquery. The file should be of following structure:

```json
{
    "items": [
       {
        "market_hash_name": "",
        "amount": 0
       }
    ]
}
```

You may also specify custom filters for your inventory items, like so:

```json
{
    "tradable": false,
    "marketable": true
}
```

More (potential) filters may be added soon.

### Debugging

In case you encounter any issues you can try running the program with either `--console` flag to print the log output to your terminal or go even further and specify the `--debug` flag which will add more verbose logs and also log to terminal.

Please use Google first to try solve your problem. Else [open an issue](https://github.com/devusSs/steamquery/issues).

### Building the app yourself

Check the [build documentation in the docs directory](./docs/build.md) for further information. Building yourself is not recommended since you need a few tools. If you do however want to build the app yourself please read the documentation.
